# JackBoxAutoVIPServer
## Introduction

JackBoxAutoVIPServer is a program that ensures you always take the VIP position in your JackBox Rooms. The VIP seat is always a good thing since it gives control over whether to start the game or wait. Your friends won't have to wait for you to join before starting the game, and you won't rush to the computer to type in the room code. It brings you confidence in your gaming environment and guarantees you take full charge of the gameplay settings.
## How It Works

The server runs on your machine, where the JackBox game runs, which means it's quite handy and fast to get the room code. It reads the room code directly from the memory. This server also comes fitted with a basic TCP server which sends back the room code. Unarguably, it's an incredibly convenient way to continually enjoy your JackBox games.
